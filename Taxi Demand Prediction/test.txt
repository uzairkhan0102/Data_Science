Tony Blair became "obsessed" with creating a British football league as a way of bringing the UK together, 
the former prime minister has revealed.
Mr Blair said he believed merging the Scottish and English leagues 
would strengthen the bonds between the two nations after devolution.
But he said a British national football team would have been a "step too far".
Mr Blair was speaking to BBC Scotland to mark the 20th 
anniversary of the devolution referendum.
The referendum was held just four months after he led Labour to a
landslide victory in the 1997 general election.
The birth of the Scottish Parliament.
Looking back at the referendum - which led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament 
in Edinburgh two years later - and its aftermath, Mr Blair said he believed 
in retrospect that he could have "looked for more ways to keep Scotland and England culturally aligned".
He told BBC Scotland's political editor Brian Taylor: "I know it sounds a bit strange but 
I was for a time quite obsessed with the idea that, for example, for football we should be opening up 
the English league and the Scottish league and having them together.
"I always thought we should be looking at ways of making sure that people felt a connection."
