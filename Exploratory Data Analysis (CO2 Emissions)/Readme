This code will help you learn working with 'Pandas' and then do the exploratory data analysis.
I am using data from two resources World bank and Gapminder.

Useful libraries for this task
numpy, for arrays
pandas, for data frames
matplotlib, for plotting
Seaborn, for plotting
Plotly, for dynamic plotting
